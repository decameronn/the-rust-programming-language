# The Rust Programming Language
#### What
Reading The Rust Programming Lanugage book.  
If there will be no exercises, I will try to follow the exercises from K&R, but implement them in Rust.  
You can read the book [online](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).  
#### Why
Why not?  
You can blame D. if you want to, for talking my ear off about Rust.  
#### When
No deadline at the moment, but this might change in the future.
